# Reagent validation in computational biology

I was asked to put together a one hour guided discussion of reproducibility and
transparency in the computational sciences for Penn
[GCB](http://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/index.shtml) students. The resulting
presentation uses (remark)[https://remarkjs.com] and is visible wherever the
web is available. The work is licensed CC-BY. Feel free to contribute your
improvements via
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/greenelab/computational-reagents/issues).
