### Text of email sent announcing this event

The NIH has announced its intent to require students funded through NRSA
mechanisms (e.g. F30/31 and training grants) to receive training in specific
elements of rigor and reproducibility as they relate to experimental design and
transparency. In response to this announcement, BGS has formulated a training
program for all students that involves BIOM 611 (or a more advanced statistics
course depending upon experience), a workshop on resource authentication and
transparency, and rigor/responsibility-focused lab meetings (see
https://www.med.upenn.edu/bgs-rcr-exdes/ for details).

The time scheduled for the workshop on resource authentication and transparency
for GCB 2nd-year PhD students and GCB MD/PhD students at a comparable level is
Wednesday, February 1 from 2:00 - 3:30 location TBD.

Participants are expected to review this slideshow now:

The slideshow contains a number of exercises that participants must carry out
*BEFORE* the meetings. Specifically, the deadline for the first set of items is
8:00AM on January 26.

The second set of items are due by 8:00AM on February 1.

Participants are expected to bring laptops to the in person discussion on
February 1. We aim to produce and disseminate a list of practices that enhance
or impede reproducibility by the end of the workshop on Feb 1.

Those who do not complete each item by the specified deadlines will not be able
to participate.
